# Flutter D&D

My first Flutter project!

## Roadmap
1. Can roll 4d6
1. Can assign rolls to stats
1. Can choose to use standard array
1. Can save character(s) locally
1. Can save characters in remote DB

I will be testing this app in Web/Android

## Resources
[Setup Guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows)

## Today I Learned
- Android Studio is by Jetbrains?! It's just like Rider.

## Setup Issues
Ran into a Gradle issue that I failed to track down. 

Recreating the project fixed the issue.
